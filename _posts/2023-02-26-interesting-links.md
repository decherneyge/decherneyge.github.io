Here are some interesting links I found last week:
- [Your B2B startup will stop innovating the day you give power to product managers](https://blog.luap.info/your-b2b-startup-will-stop-innovating-the-day-you-give-power-to-product-managers.html)

    This one made me think about the expectations I might have of a role without ever confirming these expectations are universally shared. Communication about roles and responsibilities is important.


- [lol verifier](https://brianmoore.com/lol-verifier/)

    This one is just a fun example of mixing online culture with the real world.


- [Revenue is Easy Profit is Harder](https://www.edge.ceo/p/revenue-is-easy-profit-is-harder)
    
    This one is a quick reminder that growth at all costs is not always the best strategy.


- [Setting Up An Electronics Workshop](https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/setting-up-an-electronics-workshop)

    I enjoyed reading about the things the author thought were the minimum needed for getting started in hobby electronics. I was also glad to be reminded that hobby work is extremely different from professional work when it comes to the needs of the setup. 


- [I don't like making the best things.](https://internetvin.ghost.io/i-dont-like-making-the-best-things/)

    I liked this one because it reminded me not to let perfection be the enemy of the good.


- [AI is Useful for Capitalists but Probably Terrible for Anyone Else](https://mebassett.info/ai-useful-for-capitalist)
    
    AI is everywhere right now and I thought this article was an intersting take on some potential outcomes that are more in the weeds than are typically discussed. I liked that the author went down the path of exploring the impacts in specific details. 


- [Let's build a Chrome extension that steals everything](https://mattfrisbie.substack.com/p/spy-chrome-extension)

    Having built a few Chrome extensions over the years I was immediately drawn to this one because I thought "oh yeah those are fun to build". The author shows the reality of just how easy it is for a single bad actor to collect nearly anything they want and more if we are not careful about paying attention to what we are agreeing to allow.


- [FCC Chairwoman Proposes New Rules to Block Likely Illegal Robotexts](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-chairwoman-proposes-new-rules-block-likely-illegal-robotexts)

    This one just makes me happy. I am so glad to see people are trying to fix a problem that is plaguing us all. The amount of spam texts I receive seems to be ever-increasing and I would hate to see text messaging going the way of phone calls where I basically ignore them unless I know I am expecting a call.
