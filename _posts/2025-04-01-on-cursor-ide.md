Wow!!! Just wow. I have been playing with Cursor to see what all the hype is about and I am blown away. 

I have been making web pages/apps since I was 13 (23yrs) and been professionally employed as a software engineer for the last 15 years so I feel confident self identifying as an expert in the world of web software development. I also loath overuse of the phrase "game-changer" because sprinkles on your latte is not a game-changer Bill! But this idea of vibe coding really is a game changer for the software development world. It is bringing back the fun to development. 

I spent a max of 6 hours building this little niche web-app and I didn't write a single line of code. I just talked to the IDE in plain english and even provided some screenshots of things I wanted to adjust as if I were filing a bug ticket. It was an iterative process. I asked Cursor to build the basic webapp, I played with it and realized I wanted a new feature or it to work or look differently so I asked Cursor to make the changes. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat. If someone were to have asked me to build this for them I probably would have quoted them a few weeks at least. It is mobile responsive, has light-mode/dark-mode, and can import/export data. Those seemingly small things are the bits that end up taking the longest but also make it feel like a complete app. Oh and I even had it generate the favicon image and then generate the script to convert it to a png.
